1. a) 8 mod 7 = 1
     b) 15 mod 7 = 1
     c) a<sup>-1</sup> = a<sup>(p-2)</sup> = 3<sup>5</sup> mod 7 = 243 mod 7 = 5
2. a) closure: 4 + 4 = 1 appartient Ã  S
     b) associativity: (1+2)+4=1+(2+4)
     c) identity: 5+0=0+5=5
     d) inverse: -4+4=4-4=0, -4 mod 7 = 3
     S is a group.
3. -13 mod 5 = 2 (the remainder should be positive)
4. Polynome of degree 3: (x-2)(x<sup>2</sup> + x + 6)
